Alcoholics Anonymous vs Other Treatments,Healthcare Triage,2021-08-13T23:02:12Z,"Alcoholics Anonymous has long been a treatment for alcoholism, and many, many addiction experts and people in recovery swear by the 12 step process. But what does the research show? How does AA stack up against other treatments for alcohol abuse disorder. There have been several high quality studies in recent years, and in this video Aaron will explain what they mean.

Alcoholics Anonymous and the Deflation of the Ego by Dr. Bob Weathers,CalSouthern PSYCHOLOGY,2013-04-12T18:28:25Z,"Integrates the presenter's personal visit to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting with the core philosophy of treatment within the 12-step program; namely, that the underlying source of all addictive behaviors is identification with the personal ego.  Hence, treatment is focused toward dismantling the previous identification; upon which the goal of remission of addictive behaviors follows quite organically.

A highly regarded educator and university administrator, as well as recovery coach, author, and public speaker, Dr. Bob Weathers holds a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, with an M.A. in religious studies. Over the course of his professional career, “Dr. Bob” has provided tens of thousands of hours of therapeutic counseling and recovery coaching to satisfied clients. He has also committed the past 35 years to teaching, training, and inspiring graduate-level mental health providers at several southern California universities, most recently at California Southern University. 

Dr. Bob is currently academic effectiveness coordinator at CalSouthern, engaged full-time in ongoing initiatives for improving the educational experience of our learners, including his chairing the brand-new Student Advisory Council. Additionally, Dr. Bob has published numerous articles in a broad cross-section of respected professional reference books, journals, and edited volumes.

Understanding Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and 12 Step Programs for Recovery,Counselor Carl,2020-06-30T18:11:30Z,"Counselor Carl (http://serenityonlinetherapy.com) explains what Alcoholics Anonymous and 12 Step programs are and how they came to be. He describes what happens in a meeting, what the rules are, and what the different kinds of meetings are. He also explains why the program is “spiritual” but not “religious,” which is a confusing distinction for many people. Counselor Carl's straight-forward teaching style makes complex concepts easy to understand. Counselor Carl is a licensed, professional counselor with 23 years of clinical experience both online and face-to-face.",PT6M58S,23416,609,65

Why Does Alcoholics Anonymous Work?,Healthcare Triage,2016-08-15T22:03:18Z,"Do Alcoholics Anonymous participants do better at abstinence than nonparticipants because they are more motivated? Or is it because of something inherent in the A.A. program?

How researchers answered these questions in a recent study offers insight into challenges of evidence-based medicine and evidence-informed policy. That's the topic of this week's Healthcare Triage.

"Bob D. - AA Speakers - ""Surrender""",Odomtology 12-Step Recovery Media,2013-04-03T21:37:11Z,"Bob D. does it again and absolutely knocks it out of the park! This is a wonderful tape for newcomers.  He explains, in his typical down-to-earth style the nature of ""surrender"" (a word that gets thrown around in meetings all the time).  GREAT talk from one of the best AA speakers ever!

Addiction treatment WORKS! The Twelve Step Model has been utilized as a treatment for alcohol abuse and alcoholism since 1935. It is extremely important to know that help IS out there and addiction recovery is possible.  If you are battling alcoholism, drug addiction, addiction or any other form of addictive behavior, there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site - As should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other Twelve Step Program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her alcohol abuse treatment. Substance abuse is a very serious condition and has become an epidemic in today's world.  Many people suffering with substance abuse need treatment, such as inpatient stays, rehab, or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with alcohol and drug addiction issues.  Help IS out there!

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

Every tape is carefully selected to ensure its quality and that it is entertaining to listen to. You can trust Odomtology 12-Step Recovery Media to be synonymous with the best online recovery material out there. QUALITY is our mission. That is why we have the large and engaged following that we do. Have fun and enjoy listening to the amazing, wonderful, and powerful recovery speakers!

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

Alcoholics Anonymous,Real Reviews,2012-07-03T10:54:36Z,"The General Service Office (GSO) of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) India, which operates from a tiny municipal school in Byculla, was bursting at its seams as nearly 100 AA members and volunteers attended to a torrent of calls after a national TV show flashed AA's helpline numbers and website details, on Sunday, July 1, 2012.

In its ninth episode which first aired at 11am, Satyamev Jayate focused on alcoholism and featured interviews with experts and recovering alcoholics, including AA member Laxman. As the show's producer and host Aamir Khan announced the number on air, AA offices across the country braced themselves.

Gajanan, Rotated trustee of AA India who was at the AA office in Mumbai, said, ""The number was first flashed on the show at 11.37am and at 11.40am we received the first call.Within 20 minutes, the AA website had crashed. At 12.30am, all telephone lines were jammed and missed calls started piling up. Within the next hour, we received 8,600 missed calls."" By 4pm, AA centers across India had received 13,000 calls which jumped up to 28,000 by 7 in the evening after the show aired. At the time of going to print, More than 31,000 calls were recorded.

Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of recovering alcoholics who follow the universally accepted 12 Step program for recovery from addiction. Mr. Gnyaneshwar, general manager, AA India, said, ""After a lot of groundwork, the show's research team came to the conclusion that AA programme is a reliable recovery source for alcoholism that is available pan-India and completely free of cost.""

I love how Adam relates his story and his journey to recovery.  This tape is full of laughs, but carries a strong message of hope and inspiration for us all! Sit back, relax, and enjoy! :)

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site (And as should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other 12 step program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.)

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

AA 12 Steps | Alcoholics Anonymous | AA Meetings 
In this video I'll be briefly listing  the AA 12 Steps and providing links and references for  AA Meetings, as well as talking about getting an AA Sponsor. Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and the 12 steps have been a ""go to"" for sobriety and recovery since the 1930's. An AA meeting is kind of like a support group, with everybody there sharing the same goal and common enemy: Alcoholism. AA Sponsorship is the foundation of decades of recovery.
 Alcoholics anonymous meetings aren't always about the 12 steps, although there are twelve step meetings. AA meeting topics often touch on subjests like: how to get an AA sponsor, AA sponsorship myths, what to expect at your first AA meeting, working the 12 steps of alcoholics anonymous, how AA works, or even AA myths and the question ""do AA meetings work?""
I have personal experience with working the 12 steps of AA, and i do my best to share it here on this channel weekly. Check out my AA meeting App video, where I use the App to find AA meetings near me. Alcoholics Anonymous UK doesn't have the App just yet. #soberjames #alcoholism #addictionrecovery #relapseprevention Soberdelic James supports the use of psychedelics like shrooms and cannabis in addiction recovery.",PT16M36S,41533,938,284

I appreciate celebrity AA speakers. The Alcoholism recovery stories they tell are much like yours and mine. Stevie Ray Vaughan is no exception, in this open speaker meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous  Some people may find this video by searching for Stevie Rey Von, and where aa speakers best bets are sometimes celebrities, Stevie demonstrates incredible humility and honesty. Stevie Ray Vaughan drugs...the two go hand in hand. One of quite a few musicians in recovery, few have spoken freely at an open speaker meeting aa, Stevie Ray Vaughan AA and recordings like these will hopefully help sober musicians, navigate the sometimes harsh weather of sobriety. Stevie Ray Vaughan talks about drugs, Stevie Ray Vaughan drug use,and Stevie Ray Vaughan alcohol.

Why It’s Okay To HATE Alcoholic’s Anonymous,Stop Drinking Expert,2019-04-05T13:47:55Z,"https://www.stopdrinkingexpert.com

Why It’s Okay To HATE Alcoholic’s Anonymous

If you develop a drinking problem, where do you go?

Don't say Alcoholics Anonymous until you read this!

The answer to problem drinking has never been the obvious choice. The initial pioneers turned up with a fantastic desire for bourbon and lots of it. In the early times of the nation, alcohol was among the few drinks that were dependably risk-free from pollution. (It was also less expensive than coffee beans or tea.)

The writer W. J. Rorabaugh has approximated that between the 1770s and 1830s, the typical American citizen over age 15 downed at least 5 gallons of pure alcohol a year, the rough equivalent of 3 shots of hard whiskey a day. Religious eagerness, assisted due to the introduction of communal water-filtration systems, helped arouse the soberness movement, which ended in 1920 with Prohibition. 

That venture stopped after 14 years, but the heavy drinking way of life it cultivated lingers to this day.

AA has become the default solution for problem drinking BUT it was never designed for that.",PT12M25S,23848,778,601

How I Got Sober | Being an Alcoholic and Addict,FinnTheInfinncible (Finlay Games),2019-08-20T12:51:23Z,"I am an alcoholic and addict and this is the story of my recovery from addiction to alcohol and drugs. I began my recovery journey in August 2010 with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. With the help of AA and using the one day at a time approach, I have managed to stay sober and learn to manage my mental health and my daily life.

It is also thanks to AA and to my sobriety, that I came to also realize I was transgender and found the courage to go through gender transition. That one day at a time approach has turned into a life I could have never dreamed possible.
